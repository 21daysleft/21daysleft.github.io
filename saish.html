    FEELING CONFUSED? It's completely normal to feel lost or unsure sometimes. Before jumping to conclusions, take a moment to pause and clear your mind. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and count backward from 21. Once you've calmed down a bit, try to break down the situation step by step. If something doesn't make sense, it's okay to ask questions or seek help. Remember, it's better to take a moment to understand rather than act on uncertainty. You've got this!</div>
</div>

<div class="onClickTextOverImage"

  <div>I know you're feeling demotivated and finding it hard to get started. We've all been there, and it's okay. Sometimes, the hardest part is just taking that first step. Try breaking things down into smaller tasks and tackle one thing at a time. Give yourself a little reward for each small victory. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. And if you need someone to talk to or a little push, I'm here for you.</div>
